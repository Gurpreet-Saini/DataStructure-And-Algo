You can contribute any data structure problem. Give you file an appropriate name and put it in it's respective folder.
**ONLY** new files will be entertained as an pull request. **DO NOT** edit any existing file (Changing just some lines in any existing file will be marked as Invalid or spam.)

Clone your project into your local machine using ```git clone``` command.
After adding new files and successfully push the code in your github repo, generate a pull request from your forked repository.

## Issues
#### Create a new issue if you want to edit any existing file. Other wise you can directly open an PR (pull request).
